      title: "Multimedia Design",
      overview:
        "My multimedia design skills came from exploring how visual and audio elements work together to communicate ideas effectively. It integrates illustration, photography, video, and digital editing with an emphasis on creativity, experimentation, and audience engagement.",

            "Through sustained work on Instagram, I began by developing technical and conceptual skills in illustration and drawing, creating original compositions and caricatures rooted in lowbrow art practices that emphasize expressive imagery, stylized forms, and a personal visual language."

          period: "2020 to 2023",
          description:
            "Over time, I transitioned into digital collage and image editing, using Pixlr as a free alternative to Photoshop and deliberately working within its limitations, which I treated as a creative tool rather than a restriction. This playful and exploratory approach led to visually engaging and meaningful compositions while strengthening my problem solving and design decision making skills."

            "In parallel, my YouTube work expanded these skills into motion and sound through a year long creative project in which I produced twelve music videos over twelve months, each exploring a different musical genre. This process allowed me to experiment with editing techniques, pacing, and mood, with a focus on analog inspired aesthetics and visually engaging videographic styles that highlight how visual rhythm can enhance musical expression and audience engagement."

      overview:
        "My interest in full stack development grew from my background in multimedia design and creative projects, where I learned how visual and audio elements work together to communicate ideas effectively. This foundation in illustration, photography, video, and digital editing helped shape my approach to building web applications that balance functionality with clear structure, thoughtful composition, and user focused design.",

            "Through my studies at Centennial College, I gained a strong foundation in full stack development, building practical knowledge across core coding concepts, application structure, and problem solving techniques. Although my experience in this field is recent, the program’s emphasis on hands on learning allowed me to progress quickly and apply theory directly to real projects. By combining this technical training with my background in creative design and composition, I developed an approach to full stack work that values clean implementation, clear structure, usability, and a well considered user experience."
